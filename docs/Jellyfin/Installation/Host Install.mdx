# Installing Jellyfin on Ubuntu

Jellyfin offers a modern interface for organizing and streaming media from a personal server. This tutorial details the process of installing the Jellyfin media server on Ubuntu, covering everything from the initial software installation to starting the Jellyfin service.

## Prerequisites

- A machine running Ubuntu 18.04 or later.
- Command line/terminal access.
- Sudo privileges.

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Update Your System

Before installing any new software, it's best practice to update your current system packages. In the terminal, run:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

### Step 2: Install Jellyfin

To simplify deployment and help automate this for as many users as possible, Jellyfin provides a BASH script to handle repo installation as well as installing Jellyfin. All you need to do is run this command on your system (requires curl, or subsitute curl with wget -O-):

```bash
curl https://repo.jellyfin.org/install-debuntu.sh | sudo bash
```

### Step 3: Access Jellyfin

Jellyfin will be running on your Ubuntu server. Access the web interface by navigating to:

```
http://your-server-ip:8096
```

Replace `your-server-ip` with the actual IP address of your Ubuntu server. If you're installing on a local machine, you can use `http://localhost:8096`.

### Step 5: Complete the Setup Wizard

The first time you access Jellyfin, you'll be greeted with a setup wizard. Follow the prompts to configure Jellyfin, including creating an admin user, setting up your media library, and tuning your preferred options.

## Configuring Firewall

If you have `ufw` (Uncomplicated Firewall) enabled, you need to allow traffic on Jellyfin's default port (8096):

```bash
sudo ufw allow 8096/tcp
```

## Conclusion

You've now successfully installed Jellyfin on your Ubuntu server. Jellyfin offers a great platform for streaming and organizing your media across various devices. Enjoy your personal media collection in a sleek, user-friendly interface.
